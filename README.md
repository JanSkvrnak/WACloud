# Centralized interface

### Run containers

Containers can be run through docker-compose with following command.
There is a docker image built from solr/Dockerfile, therefore if it 
is change, we also have to add a `--build` option.

- `docker-compose up -d`

### Import sample data

Sample data generated by ZCU can be found in the directory `solr/sample-data`.
To import them to the Solr index, run the following command.

- `docker exec nkp-solr post -c nkpcore /sample-data/`
